# This will be a number guesser game

* main(): the main function that will run the game. It will create a string variable with the length of 20, and then we will do a scan method to collecct the user's name and store it into that string variable. After that we will print "Hello, <name>"
	After that we will write the guesser game program that will create a integer variable which will be a random integer, and then a variable that the player's guess will go into, and a variable of the number of max guesses.
	Then we will create a while loop with the parameter KEEPGOING, which is initialized before the while loop. Then we will run the code asking for the user's input and then we will check if user input == random integer var, if true then KEEPGOING is False and if false then the system will print "Wrong answer try agian if number of guesses > 0. If number of guesses is <= 0, then the game will say that the player has lost, and KEEPGOING is turned to false.
